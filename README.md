# Latent Space Exploration Game

## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to create an interactive game that allows users to explore the latent space of generative models. We are now using the Flux model for this purpose.

## Setup
1. Install Conda if you haven't already. You can download it from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

2. Create a new Conda environment for the project:
   ```
   conda create -n flux python=3.11
   ```

3. Activate the Conda environment:
   ```
   conda activate flux
   ```

4. Install the required packages (you may need to add specific versions depending on your setup):
   ```
   pip install diffusers==0.30.0 transformers==4.43.3
   pip install sentencepiece==0.2.0 accelerate==0.33.0 protobuf==5.27.3
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
   pip install pygame
   ```

5. Run the latent space game:
   ```
   python run_latent_space_game.py 
   ```

## Aim
The aim is to create a system where:
1. Users can input semantic directions (e.g., "ice", "forest", "night")
2. The system translates these directions into meaningful movements in the latent space
3. Moving in these directions results in visible and semantically correct changes to the generated image

For example:
- Typing "ice" and moving forward should gradually add more ice-related elements to the image
- Moving backward should reduce these elements
- Lateral movements should explore variations of the concept

## Current Implementation
- We're now using the Flux model
- The system is designed to work with Flux's capabilities
- The interface allows for real-time exploration of the latent space

## Current Features
- Text-based input for semantic directions
- WASD key controls for navigation in the latent space
- Real-time image generation based on user input and movement
- Adaptive interpolation for smooth transitions between states

## Next Steps
1. Fine-tune the `update_latents` function in `experiments.py` to better translate semantic inputs into Flux-compatible directions
2. Implement more sophisticated methods for combining input directions with the current representation
3. Explore techniques like textual inversion or concept embedding to improve semantic control within Flux's framework
4. Enhance error handling and user feedback in the interface
5. Optimize performance for faster real-time interactions

## Immediate Next Steps for Code Improvement

1. Refine Flux Integration:
   - Ensure all functions are optimized for Flux's architecture
   - Implement Flux-specific optimizations for latent space navigation

2. Enhance User Interface:
   - Improve responsiveness of the pygame interface
   - Add more intuitive controls for latent space exploration

3. Optimize Performance:
   - Profile the code to identify and address performance bottlenecks
   - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently used computations

4. Improve Error Handling:
   - Add more robust error handling throughout the application
   - Implement graceful degradation for edge cases

5. Expand Documentation:
   - Update all documentation to reflect the move to Flux
   - Add more detailed comments explaining Flux-specific operations

These improvements will be implemented incrementally, with testing at each stage to ensure stability and improved performance with the Flux model.
